Next.js--- Frontend
TailwindCSS--styling
Web3--connecting to blockchain
chart.js--- Real time data visualization
Redux--- State management

Features:
Dashboard:
--> Live donation Tracker [ amount , donor, cause, timestamp]
--> Fund flow visualization [donation -> allocation -> beneficiary]
--> Search/filter option 
--> Public Audit trail

Backend:
--> FAST API (if possible)
--> MongoDB
--> Web3
--> Socket.io {Real-time update}

Backend Responsibilities:
-- query blockchain for transactions
-- user authentication {donor,charities,admins}
-- Data indexing for fast searches
-- API endpoints for frontend

Blockchain:
Solidity -- smart contracts
Ethereum (Main)
Polyglot (Test)
Hardhat (development framework)
OpenZeppelin (Pre build smart contract)

Contracts to build--
1) Donation token contract : Tracks donation records
2) Fund allocation contract: Distributes funds to causes
3) Project Milestone Contract: Verifies Project completion before fund release
4) Access Control Contract: Manages donor, charity, admin roles

Fraud Detection & AI Layer
Technology	Purpose
Python + scikit-learn	Build anomaly detection models for suspicious transaction patterns
TensorFlow/PyTorch	Deep learning for fraud classification
Chainlink Oracles	Bring external verification data on-chain (e.g., verify beneficiary existence)
Fraud Detection Rules:

Flag unusually large donations

Detect repeated donations from same wallet to multiple causes

Alert if fund allocation deviates from project plan

Track wallet history for known bad actors

Success Metrics for Hackathon Judging
Implement these to maximize your score:

Immutable Ledger ✅ Every donation recorded with transaction hash

Smart Contract Automation ✅ Funds automatically route when milestones verified

Real-time Dashboard ✅ Live donation feed with < 2 second latency

Public Audit Trail ✅ Anyone can verify any transaction with blockchain proof

Impact Metrics ✅ Show beneficiary reach, fund utilization %, project completion %

Fraud Detection ✅ Flag suspicious transactions with explanations

Gamification ✅ Donor leaderboard with badges

UI/UX Excellence ✅ Professional, intuitive interface

Code Quality ✅ Clean, documented, tested code on GitHub

Pitch & Presentation ✅ Clear explanation of problem, solution, and impact
